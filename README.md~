ReText is a simple but powerful editor for Markdown and ReStructuredText markup languages.
You can read more about ReText on our website (http://retext.sourceforge.net/) or in the wiki (http://sourceforge.net/p/retext/wiki/).

ReText is written in Python and runs on Linux and other POSIX-compatible platforms.
You do not need to compile the source code, it can be interpreted by Python (version 2 or 3).

ReText requires the following packages to run:
* python
* python-qt4
* python-markdown and/or python-docutils (ReST), depending on which kinds of documents you want to edit

These packages are needed for additional features, but are not necessary:
* python-enchant (for spell checking support)
* python-gdata (for Google Docs exporting)

Translation files are already compiled and will be automatically loaded. On Linux platform, translation files can also be loaded from /usr/share/retext/ directory.
If you want to translate ReText into your language, follow the instructions in ReText wiki.
